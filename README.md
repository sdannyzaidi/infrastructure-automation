# Infrastructure Automation Learning Project

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps practices, covering the key technologies and concepts needed for modern infrastructure automation roles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Covered
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS/GCP (free tier)

## 📚 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [x] Project setup and documentation
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- [ ] Configuration Management with Ansible
- [ ] Docker containerization basics

### Phase 2: Orchestration (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster setup and management
- [ ] Service deployments and networking
- [ ] Persistent storage and ConfigMaps

### Phase 3: Automation (Week 5-6)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline implementation
- [ ] Automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Infrastructure provisioning automation

### Phase 4: Observability (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Monitoring stack deployment
- [ ] Logging and metrics collection
- [ ] Alerting and incident response
